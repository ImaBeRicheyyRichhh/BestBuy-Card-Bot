## Workflow

This tool is designed to multitask. That means, it can run in many tabs simultaneously, if there is a ```ITEM_KEYWORD``` overlap.
If there is no ```ITEM_KEYWORD``` overlap. You will need to create a new copy of script for each ```ITEM_KEYWORD```.

Please make sure your CART is empty.

After updating variables and enabling the script in Tampermonkey, go to the your favourite GPU page in BestBuy.
If the Title of GPU has ```ITEM_KEYWORD```, it will add the item to cart and checkout. If item is out of stock it will keep on refreshing every 5 seconds.

Please use ```TESTMODE = "Yes"``` to test with an item already in stock.
